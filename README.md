# Python-Folder
I like Python, but it is not my go to language for the simple fact that it is a dynamically typed language, so the variable names can sometimes be overbearing to create. Regardless, this is a folder that is used for the purpose of storing loose python projects that range from web scrapers to simple projects. 

The projects within this repository range from simple things such as web scrapers to machine learning.

The first programming language I had learned was Python, so there might be silly projects within the repository.
